## About  

Twinklers Montessori is a website created for my PP1 project with Code Institute.
 
   
Twinklers Montessori is a business dedicated to the education of children aged from 2.5 years to school going age. This is owned by my sister in-law and the website will be used for the business. The client had full input in the design.

Twinklers Montessori needs to have a website to tell users a little bit about the business, show potential clients what services they offer.

## Designs


## Surface

#### Colour

I have used blues as my main colour theme for the website. These are colors that the client selected as they use them in their other marketing collateral. Light blue for background and dark blue for text. This will help with Accessibility for visually impaired users.

#### Typography 

I have used https://fonts.google.com/ for my fonts.  I have chosen to use Roboto and Noto Sans JP as my main font throughout the website.  This is a fairly modern style that is easy to read at various sizes.

I imported the following code into the top of my style.css file

        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+JP&family=Roboto&display=swap');

#### Call to Action

I made all my call to actions as easy to see as possible. 

* The links in the Nav/Logo are highlighted using a underline when the mouse is hovered over them.
* Contact us form is simple and easy to us and makes it easy to get in touch and ask your question
### Imagery   

Due to the business being a school I had no images to use from the company as parental permission would of had to os been given. I looked for simple and eye-catching designs that showcased the fun behind learning.

## Features

#### Universal Features Across the Site

###### Logo and Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar is at the top of the right of webpage. The nav links all underline when hovered over. The nav links direct the user to the correct page of the website. When the logo is clicked on it will take the user to the home page. When on smaller devices the nav goes underneath the logo and it is centred


###### Responsiveness

The page is scaled up and down for different screen resolutions to help the content stay neat. This has been done using media queries.


###### Accessibility

All images and navigations have an alt attributes or aria-label. This is to make the site easier to use for people with visual impairments by allowing them to navigate the site easily. There is high contrast used throughout the design. Header elements have been used in sequence so that the site makes semantic sense to screen readers. Links are consistent when hovered over. I have also set the font to rem so that if someone has their font settings higher for visibility the font size will increase accordingly.


###### Footer 

The footer is split into 3 sections:. “Opening Hours”, “Contact Info” and “Social”. These scale up and down depending on device size.
 

##### Meta data


I have included descriptions, author, and keywords into the head element to increase traffic to the website. I have also labelled each page differently so that if the user has multiple tabs open it is easy to recognise each tab.
