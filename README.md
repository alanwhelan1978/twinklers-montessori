## Designs

## Surface

#### Colour

I have used blues as my main colour theme for the website. Light blue for background and dark blue for text. This will help with Accessibility for visually impaired users.

#### Typography 

I have used https://fonts.google.com/ for my fonts.  I have chosen to use Roboto and Noto Sans JP as my main font throughout the website.  This is a fairly modern style that is easy to read at various sizes.

I imported the following code into the top of my style.css file

        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+JP&family=Roboto&display=swap');

#### Call to Action

I made all my call to actions as easy to see as possible. 

* The links in the Nav/Logo are highlighted using a underline when the mouse is hovered over them.
* Contact us form is simple and easy to us and makes it easy to get in touch and ask your question
### Imagery   

Due to the business being a school I had no images to use from the company as parental permission would of had to os been given. I looked for simple and eye-catching designs that showcased the fun behind learning.
