        <h2>Welcome to Twinklers Montessori School</h2>
        <p>
            At Twinklers have the freedom to discover, laugh, explore, play, create, sing, engage, be curious, learn and
            grow. We cater for children from 2 years 6 months to school going age. We are an Arklow based Montessori
            School with many years experience. Let your child reach their true potential at our authentic Montessori
            School.<br><br>

            We have a beautiful large classroom, with a complete range of Montessori materials. Lessons are prepared for
            each child individually and we also have group lessons. We believe the world should be brought into the
            children in the classroom, we do this by teaching gaeilge, geography, cultural studies, history, music,
            nature studies, painting, art and craft, games, exercise, imaginative play and lots and lots of fun.<br><br>
